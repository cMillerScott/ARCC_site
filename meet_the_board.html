                    <h3 class="title">President</h3>
                    <p>With being a Firefighter/EMT and Entrepreneur, Climbing has 
                       always been David’s number one passion in life.  From traveling 
                       to route development, there isn’t an aspect of climbing that 
                       doesn’t get him excited.  David enjoys spending his time for new 
                       areas to develop, projecting, and training.  He has been a member 
                       of the ARCC board since 2017 and is now motivated to volunteer and 
                       give back to the climbing community by preserving climbing areas 
                       throughout Arkansas.  Climbing has taught David how to overcome 
                       challenging obstacles, always follow your instincts, and good 
                       belayers are hard to find.  You can find me in the backwoods of 
                       Boone or Newton County with a pack full of beer and psych level high.</p>

                    <h2> Andrew Blann</h2>
                    <h3 class="title">Vice President</h3>
                    <p>Andrew Blann lives in Fayetteville with his wife Holly and cat Birch where 
                       he manages Fossil Cove Brewing Co. He has a passion for all things climbing 
                       and outdoor recreation. Born in Kansas, Andrew spent countless summers 
                       exploring the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks by land and water. He started 
                       climbing in 2005 and was shortly introduced to Arkansas climbing on a summer 
                       trip to Sam’s Throne with a group of Kansas City climbers, despite the 
                       humidity, bugs, poison ivy and sweat, Andrew was hooked. Since his first 
                       Arkansas climbing experience he’s spent countless days climbing, exploring, 
                       developing and enjoying the amazing climbing resources the Ozarks have to offer. 
                       According to Andrew, Arkansas is one of the most underrated states for climbing, 
                       unless you hate uncrowded crags, bullet rock and wild spaces. Andrew also has a 
                       secret love for choss and Missouri limestone.</p>

              <h2>Chase Webb</h2>
              <h3 class="title">Secretary</h3>
              <p>Chase joined the Arkansas Climbers Coalition Board of Directors in fall 2017. 
                 He resides in Fayetteville, AR with his wife and fellow board member, Judith 
                 Brown, where he works as a Civil Engineer for ESI.  Chase began climbing in 
                 2012 while attending Oklahoma State University and immediately became immersed 
                 in the sport. He made the trek from Stillwater to the Ozarks during most 
                 weekends and became familiarized with the backwoods of Arkansas. Although his 
                 “home crags” were the Wichita Mountains and the Ozarks, climbing has taken him 
                 all over the United States, showing him a broad range of styles and ethics.  
                 Chase hopes his passion for all disciplines of climbing, devotion to re-bolting 
                 routes and diverse climbing background will keep pushing Arkansas climbing in 
                 the right direction.</p>

                    <h2>Judith Brown</h2>
                    <h3 class="title">Treasurer</h3>
                    <p>Although a native of the Natural State, Judith began her climbing journey in 
                       Oklahoma in 2009.  On a trip to Charon’s Gardens in the Wichita Wildlife Refuge, 
                       Judith got her first taste of outdoor climbing on the classic climbs of Lost Dome.  
                       Since then, Judith has taken her love of climbing to multiple states and countries.  
                       In Arkansas, when she isn’t working as an administrator for Arkansas Children’s, 
                       you’ll likely find Judith climbing or rebolting with her life [belaying] partner, 
                       Chase Webb!  Chase and Judith love heading west any chance they get.  In particular, 
                       Judith loves climbing in Northern New Mexico & Joshua Tree for their remote climbing 
                       areas, beautiful desert views, and, of course, the food!  Since moving back to 
                       Arkansas in 2017, Judith has made it a point to champion climbing in Arkansas and 
                       to carry out the ARCC mission, to preserve and protect climbing, to the best of 
                       her ability.  She looks forward to seeing the Arkansas climbing community continue 
                       to grow!</p>
